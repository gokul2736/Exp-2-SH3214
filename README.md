# 2. Determination of size of the particle using diode laser 
## Name: M.Gokul
## Reg No: 24000042

## AIM:
To determine the size of the particle using diode laser.    

## APPARATUS REQUIRED:  
Semiconductor diode laser, Fine micro particles (lycopodium powder), glass plate, screen, metre scale.

## FORMULA:  
Size of the micro particles is   

d = (n λ D) / xₙ metre


### Where,   
n - Order of diffraction  
λ - Wavelength of Laser source (metre)  
D - Distance between glass plate and the screen (metre)  
xₙ - Distance between central bright spot and the n^{th} fringe (metre)

### PROCEDURE  
• A glass plate is taken and powder of the particle size in the range of micrometer 
   is sprinkled on the glass plate.  
• This glass plate is kept between laser light and screen.  
• Now laser beam gets diffracted by the particles present in the glass plate.  
• By adjusting the distance between the glass plate and the screen, a circular fringe pattern is seen on the screen.  
• Fringes of different order are seen on the screen and it is measured. 
​
Using the formula d = \frac{n \lambda D}{x_n} the particle size can be found.  
The experiment is repeated for different D values.
